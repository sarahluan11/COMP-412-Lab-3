This archive contains a stripped down version of the auto-grader for COMP 412
Lab 3 -- the local instruction scheduler.

To complete installation, you need to change the definition of base_name in
the files auto_grade/auto_grade.py. and auto_time/auto_time.py.  base_name
should hold the pathname to the directory where this README file resides.
(Use pwd to check the name if you are unsure.) The base_name string must
end in a slash.

To test your installation, invoke ./Grader and ./Timer with the test
tar files that come installed in the directory ./TarFileGoesHere. Those
command should invoke the autograder and the autotimer.

Remove the demonstration tar files once you know that the installation works.

To test your submission, place your archive in ./TarFileGoesHere and invoke
RunGrader. 

To double check that neither your code nor your scripts need access to the 
files in your directory structure, I would install l3ag outside of the file
system subtree where your code normally lives.  I would temporarily change
the permission on the directory where you developed your submission:

    chmod 000 my-lab-3-directory

and run the auto-grader. You can change the permissions back after the test 

    chmod 700 my-lab-3-directory

(or whatever permissions you use).
