COMP 412, Fall 2024

This directory contains the tools to test and pass the two code checks for
Lab 2. Both code check scripts have simple syntax.

The CodeCheck scripts use the Lab 2 simulator, so you need to run them
on CLEAR.

TO RUN THE CODE CHECKS:

For code check 1:

    ~comp412/students/lab2/CodeChecks/CodeCheck1  foo

and for code check 2:

    ~comp412/students/lab2/CodeChecks/CodeCheck2  foo

where, in either case, foo is the Linux pathname of your executable.

You should run the code checks from a directory where you have write permission,
because they leave behind a logfile (named netid.log where netid is the netid
used to run the script). We recommend you run them from the directory where
your executable lives, as in

   ~comp412/students/lab2/CodeChecks/CodeCheck1 ./412alloc
and
   ~comp412/students/lab2/CodeChecks/CodeCheck2 ./412alloc

Of course, you can copy the script into that directory, which would allow you
to run the code checks as

   ./CodeCheck1  ./412alloc
and
    ./CodeCheck2 ./412alloc

RESULTS OF THE CODE CHECKS:

The Code Check will print out summary results to the standard output file.
The last line will state whether the tested executable passed or failed

If the executable failed the test, the logfile may contain more information
that helps you understand what happened.

SUBMITTING THE RESULTS OF YOUR CODE CHECK:

To submit your results, take a screen shot of the results and upload it to
the appropriate assignment on Canvas. These screenshots are manually graded,
so it may take several days before credit appears in the Canvas Gradebook.
