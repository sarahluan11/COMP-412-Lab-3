This directory contains a couple of python scripts intended to help test your 
lab 3 scheduler. 

   test:  a script for testing correctness

TEST SCRIPT: To use this script, copy it into your file system. 
The syntax is simple:

   test <executable name>  <directory of ILOC files>

So, to run lab3_ref on the lab3 report blocks, you might type

   ./test ~comp412/students/lab3/lab3_ref  ~comp412/students/lab3/report

The script reports its results in two ways. It prints a brief summary to
stdout. It writes a logfile in the current directory, named with your netid.
The logfile contains the outcome on each tested file, along with the cycle
count for executing the original code and the scheduled code.

If the test script reports that the scheduler under test failed on some 
file x, that tells you that the scheduled code for that file produced 
different results than the original code. 

NOTE: The script writes the log file into the directory where it is invoked.
For that reason, you should copy 'test' into your own file system subtree.
It overwrites the log file on every run.

Do not try to run multiple instances of the tester from multiple shells on 
the same machine. The tester creates a directory in /tmp to hold all of the
miscellaneous files that it creates. Having multiple tester instances sharing
a single temporary directory will likely produce really bad results.

TIMER: We used to supply a quick timing script. We have removed it. We
recommend that you use the timing facilities in the autograder and the
autotimer.
